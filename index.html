<h1>HEADHUNTER BOTS</h1>
Both friends and strangers have come together to optimize each others' strengths and skills. Each member comes from a different education background which enabled us to create a robot that is able to accomplish a variety of tasks. The robot combines mechanical, electrical and programming components to seek specific targets to activate its killing mechanism. As the robot roams the unknown, it knows how to avoid deadly obstacles and cliff falls. The robot has one mission and one mission only; to eliminate the target. A rocket launcher and mobile camera is attached to a Chasis that allows the robot to find its preys once it recognizes their face. Not only is the robot deadly, the robot is devilishly good looking.
