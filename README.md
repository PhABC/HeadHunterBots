# HeadHunterBots
This is a object avoiding and human targeting robot developed by a team of university students at the Robohacks Hackathon at McGill University.
Using Python, OpenCV, and Arduino, we developed a face recognition robot that searches its environment while avoiding objects and ledges. Once it detects a face, it stops and fires a projectile at the target from a custom 3-D printed cannon.
